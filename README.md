## üìã Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your local development machine:
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Latest LTS version recommended, ideally managed via [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
* [Yarn Package Manager (v1.x)](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (Ensure it is running)
* [Redis](https://redis.io/) (for session management - can be Docker-based)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Setup & Running (Docker-First for Development)

This project is best developed and run using the provided Docker configuration for stability.

### 1. Clone the Repository
If you haven't already, clone the project to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd leads-support-agent-smb
```

### 2. Create and Configure the .env File
This file stores your environment-specific variables and secrets. It is not committed to Git.

In the root of the project (leads-support-agent-smb/), create a file named `.env`.

Add the following variables, replacing placeholder values with your actual credentials:

```bash
# Application Port (used by Docker Compose to expose the app container)
PORT=3000

# Database URL for LOCAL PRISMA STUDIO to connect to the DOCKERIZED PostgreSQL database.
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://db_user:db_password@localhost:5433/app_db?schema=public"
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://db_user:db_password@localhost:5433/app_db?schema=public"

# Redis Configuration (for session management)
REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"

# Secrets (Generate strong random strings for these)
JWT_SECRET="YOUR_VERY_STRONG_RANDOM_JWT_SECRET_HERE"

# OpenAI API Key
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE"

# Twilio Configuration (for voice features)
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID="AC_YOUR_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID"
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="your_twilio_auth_token"
TWILIO_WEBHOOK_BASE_URL="https://your-domain.com"

# Node Environment for local Docker development
NODE_ENV=development

# Frontend URLs for CORS
APP_PRIMARY_URL=http://localhost:3000 
ADMIN_CUSTOM_DOMAIN_URL=https://app.cincyaisolutions.com
WIDGET_DEMO_URL=https://demo.cincyaisolutions.com
WIDGET_TEST_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

**Important Voice Features Note:** The voice agent system requires Twilio configuration for full functionality. PRO tier features include advanced voice customization and premium voice options.

### 3. Build and Start Docker Containers
Make sure Docker Desktop is running. In your project root terminal:

Build the application image (if first time or Dockerfile changes):
```bash
docker-compose build
# (Or docker compose build for newer Docker CLI syntax)
```

Start the application and database containers:
```bash
docker-compose up
# (Or docker compose up)
```
This will show combined logs from the app and db services. The app service will run `yarn dev`.

### 4. Run Database Migrations (First Time Setup or Schema Changes)
Once docker-compose up shows the database (db service) is healthy and the app (app service) is running or trying to start:

1. Open a new, separate terminal window.
2. Navigate to your project root.
3. Execute the Prisma migrate command inside the running app container:
```bash
docker-compose exec app npx prisma migrate dev --name initial_docker_setup
# (Or docker compose exec app .... Use a descriptive migration name.)
```
This creates tables in your Dockerized PostgreSQL database.

### 5. Accessing the Application (Locally via Docker)
* **AI Agent Backend API & Admin UI:** http://localhost:3000
* **Admin Login Page:** http://localhost:3000/admin/login
* **System Health Check:** http://localhost:3000/health (includes Redis status and session analytics)
* **Voice System Health:** http://localhost:3000/api/voice/health (detailed voice system monitoring)
* **Voice Webhook Endpoints:** http://localhost:3000/api/voice/* (Twilio integration)
* **Chat Widget Script:** http://localhost:3000/widget.js
* **Session Analytics:** Available in admin dashboard for PRO users with Redis status monitoring

### 6. Testing the Chat Widget Locally
Create a test.html file in your project root (if not already present):
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head><meta charset="UTF-8"><title>Widget Test</title></head>
<body>
    <h1>My Local Test Site for Widget</h1>
    <script src="http://localhost:3000/widget.js" data-business-id="YOUR_TEST_BUSINESS_ID_FROM_DOCKER_DB" defer></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Replace `YOUR_TEST_BUSINESS_ID_FROM_DOCKER_DB` with a valid Business ID from your Dockerized database.

Serve this test.html file using live-server:
1. Ensure live-server is installed: `npm install -g live-server` (or `yarn global add live-server`).
2. In a new terminal, `cd` to your project root (or where test.html is).
3. Run `live-server`. It will open the page, usually at http://127.0.0.1:8080.
4. Your backend's CORS configuration (using WIDGET_TEST_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080 from .env passed to Docker) should allow this.

### 7. Accessing the Dockerized Database with Prisma Studio
To view/edit data in the Dockerized PostgreSQL database using Prisma Studio from your Mac:

1. Ensure your local .env file (in the project root on your Mac) has DATABASE_URL and DIRECT_URL pointing to localhost:5433 (as shown in Setup Step 2).
2. Ensure your Docker containers are running (`docker-compose up`).
3. In a new terminal window (on your Mac, in the project root), run:
```bash
npx prisma studio
```
This opens Prisma Studio in your browser at http://localhost:5555, connected to the database inside your Docker db container.

## üìú Key Scripts (package.json)

These are run using `yarn <scriptname>` (or `npm run <scriptname>`). When using Docker for development, most are run via `docker-compose exec app yarn <scriptname>` or are part of the Dockerfile/docker-compose.yml commands.

* `"dev": "nodemon src/server.ts"`: Starts the development server with hot-reloading using nodemon and ts-node. (This is the default command for the app service in docker-compose.yml).
* `"build": "yarn prisma:generate && tsc"`: Generates Prisma Client and compiles TypeScript to JavaScript (output to dist/ folder).
* `"start": "node dist/server.js"`: Runs the compiled JavaScript application (for production).
* `"prisma:generate": "prisma generate"`: Generates Prisma Client.
* `"prisma:migrate": "prisma migrate dev"`: Creates and applies a new database migration during development.

Running Prisma commands with Docker:
```bash
docker-compose exec app npx prisma migrate dev --name <migration_name>
docker-compose exec app yarn prisma:generate # (or docker-compose exec app npx prisma generate)
docker-compose exec app npx prisma db seed # (if you set up a seed script)
```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment Overview (Render.com)

This application is designed to be deployed as a Dockerized Web Service on Render.com, with a separate PostgreSQL instance also managed by Render.

* **Git Repository:** Code is hosted on GitHub/GitLab.
* **Render PostgreSQL:** A managed PostgreSQL instance on Render (with pgvector extension available, e.g., by using an image like pgvector/pgvector or ensuring the chosen Render Postgres version supports it).
* **Render Web Service:**
    * Connects to the Git repository.
    * Uses the Dockerfile for building the production image.
    * Environment variables are set in the Render dashboard (for DATABASE_URL pointing to Render's internal DB URL, OPENAI_API_KEY, JWT_SECRET, NODE_ENV=production, and various FRONTEND_URLS for CORS).
    * Start command is `yarn start` (which runs `node dist/server.js`).
* **Migrations on Render:** After a successful deploy, database migrations are applied using Render's environment or by remotely connecting: `npx prisma migrate deploy`.
* **Custom Domains:** Configured on Render and Namecheap (or other DNS provider) for app.cincyaisolutions.com (pointing to Render Web Service) and demo.cincyaisolutions.com (pointing to a static site host like Vercel).

## üîÆ Future Enhancements (V1.1 / V2 and Beyond)
