# Leads Support AI Agent for SMBs

## üöÄ Overview

The Leads Support AI Agent is a sophisticated chatbot application designed to empower Small to Medium-Sized Businesses (SMBs) by automating customer interactions, capturing leads effectively, and providing 24/7 FAQ support. It leverages advanced AI capabilities, including Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), to deliver intelligent and contextual responses.

This project provides a multi-tenant backend API, an AI core logic handler, an embeddable chat widget for client websites, and an admin dashboard for SMBs to configure their agent and manage leads.

## ‚ú® MVP Features

* **AI-Powered Chat Widget:** A JavaScript-based widget easily embeddable on any SMB website.
* **Dual AI Modes:**
    * **FAQ Answering:** Utilizes a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system with a configurable knowledge base to answer customer questions accurately based on business-specific information. Embeddings are generated for knowledge base entries and stored in a PostgreSQL database with the `pgvector` extension for similarity searches.
    * **Lead Capture Flow:** Guides potential customers through a series of configurable questions (e.g., name, email, phone, service needs) to capture lead details.
* **Intent Classification:** AI determines user intent to seamlessly switch between FAQ and Lead Capture modes.
* **Emergency Lead Prioritization:** Identifies urgent leads based on user input and can flag them accordingly (e.g., setting a priority in the database).
* **Email Notifications:** Automatically sends email notifications to the SMB owner/designated email when a new lead (especially an urgent one) is captured.
* **Admin Dashboard (for SMBs):** A web interface for SMB clients to:
    * Securely log in.
    * Manage general agent settings: Agent Name, Persona Prompt (system message for AI), Welcome Message, Chat Widget Color Theme.
    * Manage Lead Capture Questions: Add and view the sequence of questions the AI will ask. (Edit/Delete are V1.1 features). Includes mapping questions to specific lead fields like `contactName`, `contactEmail`.
    * Manage Knowledge Base: Add and view text-based entries that the AI uses for FAQ answers. Embeddings are automatically generated and stored for these entries. (Edit/Delete are V1.1 features).
    * View Captured Leads: Display a list of all leads captured by their agent, including captured data and contact information.
* **Multi-Tenant Architecture:** Designed to support multiple SMB clients from a single deployed application, with data isolation per business.
* **Dockerized Development Environment:** Ensures a consistent and reliable development setup.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript
* **AI & NLP:** OpenAI API (GPT models for chat completion & intent classification, `text-embedding-3-small` for RAG embeddings)
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (with `pgvector` extension for vector similarity search)
* **ORM:** Prisma
* **Real-time Development Server:** `nodemon` with `ts-node`
* **Frontend Chat Widget:** Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS (dynamically injected)
* **Admin Dashboard UI:** EJS (Embedded JavaScript templates) rendered by Express.js, with client-side JavaScript for form submissions.
* **Email Notifications:** Nodemailer (configured with Ethereal.email for development)
* **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) stored in HttpOnly cookies.
* **Password Hashing:** `bcrypt`
* **Development & Deployment Environment:** Docker, Docker Compose
* **Package Manager:** Yarn (recommended due to stability in this project's development)

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (latest LTS version recommended, ideally managed via [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
* [Yarn Package Manager](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) (v1.x)
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (ensure it's running)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Setup & Running (Docker First - Recommended)

This project is configured to run in a Dockerized environment for stability and consistency.

### 1. Clone the Repository (If applicable)
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd leads-support-agent-smb
``` 

### 2. Create and Configure the `.env` File
This file stores your environment-specific variables and secrets.

In the root of the project, create a file named `.env`.

Copy the content from `.env.example` (if provided) or add the following variables, replacing placeholder values with your actual credentials:

```bash
# Application Port
PORT=3000

# Database URL for Prisma (when running Prisma commands locally like `prisma studio`)
# This points to the PostgreSQL database EXPOSED BY DOCKER on your host machine.
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://db_user:db_password@localhost:5433/app_db?schema=public"
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://db_user:db_password@localhost:5433/app_db?schema=public"

# Secrets (Generate strong random strings for these)
JWT_SECRET="YOUR_VERY_STRONG_RANDOM_JWT_SECRET_HERE"

# OpenAI API Key
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE"

# Node Environment
NODE_ENV=development

# Frontend URL (for CORS in production, can be localhost for dev if widget served separately)
# For development with test.html via live-server, this might be http://127.0.0.1:8080
# For development with test.html via file:/// and the admin dashboard on localhost:3000,
# the CORS config in server.ts handles 'null' and 'http://localhost:3000' in dev.
FRONTEND_URL=
```

### 3. Build and Start Docker Containers
Make sure Docker Desktop is running. In your project root:

**Build the application image:**

```bash
docker-compose build
```
(Or `docker compose build` for newer Docker CLI versions)

This might take a few minutes the first time.

**Start the application and database containers:**

```bash
docker-compose up
```
(Or `docker compose up`)

You will see logs from both the `app` and `db` containers.

### 4. Run Database Migrations (First Time Setup)
Once `docker-compose up` shows the database (`db` service) is healthy and the app (`app` service) is trying to start:

1. Open a new, separate terminal window.
2. Navigate to your project root.
3. Execute the Prisma migrate command inside the running app container:

```bash
docker-compose exec app npx prisma migrate dev --name initial_setup
```
(Or `docker compose exec app ...`)

This will create all necessary tables in your Dockerized PostgreSQL database.

### 5. Accessing the Application
* **AI Agent Backend API & Admin UI:** http://localhost:3000
* **Admin Login Page:** http://localhost:3000/admin/login
* **Health Check Endpoint:** http://localhost:3000/health
* **Chat Widget Script (served by the app):** http://localhost:3000/static/widget.js

**Testing the Chat Widget:**

1. Create a simple `test.html` file in your project root (or anywhere):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head><meta charset="UTF-8"><title>Widget Test</title></head>
<body>
    <h1>My Test Site</h1>
    <script src="http://localhost:3000/static/widget.js" data-business-id="YOUR_TEST_BUSINESS_ID" defer></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Replace `YOUR_TEST_BUSINESS_ID` with a valid Business ID from your database.

2. Serve this `test.html` file using a local HTTP server (to avoid `file:///` CORS issues):
   - Ensure `live-server` is installed: `npm install -g live-server` (or `yarn global add live-server`).
   - In the terminal, `cd` to the directory containing `test.html`.
   - Run `live-server`. It will open the page, usually at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.
   - Your backend's CORS configuration in `src/server.ts` needs to allow `http://127.0.0.1:8080` (or the port `live-server` uses) when `NODE_ENV=development`.

### 6. Accessing the Dockerized Database with Prisma Studio
To view/edit data in the Dockerized PostgreSQL database using Prisma Studio:

1. Ensure your local `.env` file has the `DATABASE_URL` and `DIRECT_URL` pointing to `localhost:5433` as described in step 2.
2. Ensure your Docker containers are running (`docker-compose up`).
3. In a new terminal window (on your Mac, in the project root), run:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

This will open Prisma Studio in your browser at http://localhost:5555, connected to the database inside your Docker container.

## üìú Key Scripts

These scripts are typically defined in `package.json` and run via Yarn (or npm). When using Docker, the primary script `yarn dev` is run by `docker-compose.yml` for the app service.

* **`yarn dev`**: Starts the development server using `nodemon` and `ts-node` for hot-reloading. (This is the command used by `docker-compose.yml` for the app service).
* **`yarn build`**: (You would add this script) Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript, e.g., `tsc`. Used for production builds.
* **`npx prisma migrate dev --name <migration_name>`**: Creates and applies a new database migration. (Run via `docker-compose exec app ...` when using Docker).
* **`npx prisma generate`**: Generates/updates Prisma Client. (Run via `docker-compose exec app ...` after schema changes if not relying solely on the Docker build step).
* **`npx prisma studio`**: Opens Prisma Studio to view/manage database data. (Run from your Mac terminal, configured `.env` to point to Docker DB's exposed port).
