## 1. Introduction: The Problem

Creative agencies thrive on deep work and client relationships. However, their most valuable resources—the time and focus of their project managers, creatives, and leaders—are constantly eroded by a high volume of routine client communication. Every phone call to check a project's status, every email asking about the billing cycle, and every "quick question" is an interruption that forces context switching, kills momentum, and pulls skilled professionals away from billable, high-impact work.

This "interruption tax" leads to decreased operational efficiency, frustrated employees, and a client experience that feels reactive rather than proactive. Smaller agencies struggle to appear professional and responsive, while larger agencies struggle to scale their client service without ballooning their overhead.

## 2. Vision & Opportunity

Our vision is to transform client communication from an operational bottleneck into a competitive advantage for creative agencies.

StudioConnect AI will be the AI-powered communication platform that evolves with an agency's needs. It starts by serving as the perfect, professional front door (capturing leads and qualifying calls) and matures into an indispensable AI Account Manager that is deeply integrated into the agency's workflow, capable of autonomously handling client service inquiries.

By automating routine communication, we will free agency teams to focus on what they do best: creating exceptional work and building strategic client relationships.

## 3. Target Audience & Personas

We are building this product exclusively for Creative Agencies (branding, web design, marketing, digital, etc.).

### Persona 1: The Agency Owner / Founder
- **Goals:** Drive growth, maintain profitability, establish a premium brand presence.
- **Pains:** Missing new business opportunities after hours, stretching a small team to handle all inbound communication, high overhead costs for administrative staff.
- **Quote:** "I need to know that every potential lead is handled professionally, but I can't afford a full-time receptionist. How do we grow without breaking the bank?"

### Persona 2: The Head of Operations / Project Manager
- **Goals:** Ensure projects are delivered on time and on budget, keep clients happy, maximize team efficiency.
- **Pains:** Constant interruptions from clients asking for status updates, acting as a human router for information, repetitive manual communication tasks.
- **Quote:** "My day is a series of interruptions. If I could just get a few hours of uninterrupted time for my team, our output would skyrocket."

### Persona 3: The Client of the Agency
- **Goals:** To feel informed, valued, and confident that their project is progressing.
- **Pains:** Waiting hours or days for a simple email reply, feeling like they are "in the dark" about project status, not knowing who to contact for what.
- **Quote:** "I just want a quick update, but I feel like I'm bothering them every time I send an email."

## 5. User Stories & Requirements

This product will launch with two distinct tiers:

### Tier 1: PRO Plan ("The AI Studio Manager")
**Focus:** New Business & Professional Presence

| User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|------------|---------------------|
| As an Agency Owner, I want the AI to answer all calls 24/7 so that I never miss a new business lead. | System handles all inbound calls to the designated Twilio number. |
| As a Studio Manager, I want to define a set of qualifying questions so that the AI can vet potential leads. | Admin dashboard allows for creation/editing of a question-and-answer flow for lead capture. |
| As an Agency Owner, I want to receive email summaries and transcripts of calls so that I can follow up. | Email notifications are sent to a designated address upon call completion with a summary, transcript, and lead details. |
| As an Agency Owner, I want to customize the AI's name and voice so that it aligns with my brand. | Admin dashboard provides options for setting the AI's persona and selecting from a list of voices. |

### Tier 2: ENTERPRISE Plan ("The AI Account Manager")
**Focus:** Client Service Automation & Operational Efficiency (Includes all PRO features)

| User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|------------|---------------------|
| As a Head of Ops, I want to connect our project management tool (Asana, Jira) via an API token so that the system has access to project data. | Admin dashboard has a secure section to input API credentials for supported PM tools; system validates the token. |
| As a Head of Ops, I want the system to perform a one-way sync of project data so that our AI has fast, local access to status updates. | System periodically fetches project/task data and stores relevant fields (name, status, details, client) in its own database. A manual "Sync Now" button is also available. |
| As a Project Manager, I want the system to use Webhooks to receive real-time updates from our PM tool so that the information is always current. | System can receive and process webhook events from Asana/Jira to update the status of specific projects in its database. |
| As a Project Manager, I want the system to recognize existing clients by their phone number so that they receive a personalized experience. | When a call is received, the system checks the From number against the agency's client list in the database. |
| As a Client, I want to ask for the status of my project over the phone so that I can get an instant update without waiting for an email reply. | If an existing client asks about a project, the AI uses its synced data to provide a specific, accurate, real-time status update. |
| As a Head of Ops, I want to build an interactive FAQ so that the AI can answer common client questions about our agency (e.g., billing, feedback). | Admin dashboard includes a "Knowledge Base" or "FAQ" section where Q&A pairs can be created for the AI to use. |

## 6. Features Out of Scope (For This Version)

To ensure a focused and timely launch, the following features will not be included in Version 1.0:

- **Two-Way Project Management Sync:** The AI will not create or update tasks in Asana/Jira via voice commands. This is a one-way (read-only) integration for now.
- **User-Level OAuth 2.0 Integration:** The initial release will use a single, admin-provided API token for integration, not individual user connections.
- **Client-Facing Dashboard:** The agency's clients will not have a portal to log into. All interaction is via the phone.
- **Multi-Language Support:** The system will launch with English-only support.
- **Chat/SMS Integration:** This version is focused exclusively on perfecting the voice channel.

## 7. Design & UX Considerations

The user interface for the admin dashboard must be clean, intuitive, and simple. Agency owners are busy and not necessarily deeply technical. The design should inspire confidence and professionalism, mirroring the quality they provide to their own clients. The setup process for integrations and AI configuration must be guided and include clear validation steps.
